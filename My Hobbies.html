<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>Beyond web development, I have a strong passion for football and video games. Playing football keeps me active and teaches me the importance of teamwork, strategy, and dedicationâ€”qualities I bring into my professional work as well.<p>On the other hand, video games challenge my problem-solving skills and creativity, which directly translates to my approach in coding and design.</p> 

    </p>These hobbies not only provide balance in my life but also inspire me to think creatively and develop innovative solutions in my web development projects.
